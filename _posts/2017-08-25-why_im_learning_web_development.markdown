I was twelve when I started tinkering with the copy of Microsoft FrontPage on my family's computer. The idea of building my own website seemed magical at the time - in the sense that it was pretty awesome, but also in the sense that I knew absolutely nothing about how any of it worked. I was, like many people, a huge Harry Potter fan when I was twelve years old, so naturally my first real website was a Harry Potter fan site. It was hosted on Geocities and there were ten or so pages with information and links related to the books and movies.

I spent many, many hours improving that first site and building new incarnations of it over the next years. There was a whole community of Harry Potter fan website-creators at that time, so I looked at what other people were making and drew inspiration from them. I would "View Source" on a page and figure out what the different parts were doing through trial and error, even if it didn't make sense at first. Or I'd ask someone, or find a tutorial. I started to understand HTML and CSS. I learned about website hosting and domain names and FTP, and how to install programs like WordPress. I even learned enough PHP to make basic changes to other people's code. When I outgrew my Harry Potter sites, I continued to learn by creating other websites related to my interests; in university, I designed the sites for several of the student groups I was part of.

I studied English Literature and Creative Writing in university, since these were (and are) two major passions of mine. I didn't even consider a major in Computer Science - partly because I didn't have the necessary math skills, but also because it always seemed so far removed from the type of website-making that I was doing. Recently, though, I've realized that although I'm excited to keep working on my personal writing projects, I'd have a lot more fun designing websites than doing most of the jobs that are more directly suited to English majors. Given that I already knew the basics and knew that I enjoyed it, learning more advanced web development was an easy decision for me.

There are a lot of things that draw me to web development. I love the creativity of it. I love that it involves making things and putting things together in different ways. I love the process of seeing something on the web like an interesting page layout or menu or animation, thinking "I want to do that!", and Googling to figure out how it works. Web development is one of the few things that I can get totally immersed in for an entire day without getting bored.

Even though I have some prior experience, I still feel like a complete beginner in a lot of ways. Prior to a few months ago, I'd never seriously tried to learn programming - not even basic JavaScript - and I'd certainly never written my own program. So it's been great to finally get started on some of these more advanced topics, and I'm really looking forward to learning so many new things as I work through the Flatiron curriculum. I'd love to connect with other students in the program, especially with anyone based in the Seattle area.

I'll close my first post with an early screenshot of a page on my first website: laid out with a jumble of tables, riddled with `<font>` tags, and designed for 800x600 resolution monitors! I hadn't figured out how to align Hermione's hand in the header image with her arm in the sidebar yet.
